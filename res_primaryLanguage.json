In this project , we attempt to develop a biometric (Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal) based user authentication system that can potentially be used by clients as a log-in interface for their users. Technologies Used - Python's mne (package to process EEG signal data), scikit-learn and PyQt5 for GUI.",
